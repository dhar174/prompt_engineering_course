Absolutely! Here is a **detailed, minute-by-minute teaching plan for Day 1** of your Prompt Engineering class, skillfully incorporating all relevant foundational concepts from the 155-point catalogue. The day balances lecture, demonstration, hands-on mini-exercises, and Q\&A, and sets up core skills and conceptual language for the rest of the course.

---

## **Prompt Engineering: Day 1 – LLM Internals & Prompt Anatomy (Foundational Controls)**

**Theme:**
*How and why prompts work, what controls are available, and how the architecture and decoding parameters of LLMs shape all prompt outcomes.*

### **0–15 min | Welcome & Course Introduction**

* Instructor/TA intro; Zoom logistics.
* Syllabus and class goals walk-through.
* **Prompt Engineering in 2025:** skills, jobs, landscape.
* **Mindset:** *Iterative-Development*—experiment, debug, refine.

---

### **15–55 min | Tokenization & Context Windows**

* **What is a “prompt” to an LLM?** Tokenization basics:

  * **Tokenisation Fundamentals:** BPE, WordPiece.
  * **Sub-word Tokenisation:** why “cats” ≠ “cat” + “s.”
  * **Context-Window Awareness:** max context, what “truncation” really means.
  * **Max-Tokens Setting:** length, truncation, and output budgeting.
* *Live Demo:* Tokenizing various text samples, watching model’s actual context limits (OpenAI tiktoken, HF Tokenizers).
* *Q\&A:* Why does token count matter? Real-world API cost/rate-limits.

---

### **55–90 min | Model Internals: Attention, Role Structure, and Output Controls**

* **Self-Attention & Cross-Attention:** high-level architecture, what “attention” means for prompts.
* **System/User/Assistant Segregation:** the anatomy of a modern prompt (system prompt, roles, delimiters).
* **Prompt Templates:** anatomy, use, placeholder logic.
* **Word/Character-Limit Control:** API limits, enforcing short/long responses.
* *Quick Exercise:* Students write a prompt to elicit exactly 15 words.

---

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Tone, Style, Formality & Reading-Level Controls**

* **Tone / Style Constraints:** controlling voice and register (e.g., casual, formal, poetic, technical).
* **Formal vs Informal Output:** why it matters in business/education.
* **Reading-Level Adjustment:** Flesch-Kincaid, explicit instructions, and LLM response calibration.
* *Live Demo:* Prompting for style (e.g., “Explain quantum mechanics to a 9-year-old” vs. “Compose a legal opinion”).
* *Mini-Exercise:* Students try “style transfer” prompts; share best results in chat.

---

### **135–165 min | Ideation Modes & Prompt Diversity**

* **Divergent vs Convergent Ideation Prompts:**

  * Divergent: brainstorming, creative generation (“Give 10 wild ideas for…”).
  * Convergent: focused, precise, summary, or narrowing tasks (“Summarize into one key point…”).
* *Group Demo:* Class brainstorms divergent vs convergent prompts on the same topic and compares output.
* *Token budgeting revisit:* How prompt style affects response length.

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–240 min | Decoding Parameters & Sampling (Hands-On)**

* **Temperature Modulation:** randomness vs. determinism.
* **Top-k Sampling, Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling:** steering output diversity.
* **Presence/Frequency Penalties:** forcing/limiting repetitions.
* *Live Playground:* OpenAI or local model; instructor shows how one prompt changes across temp/top-k/top-p.
* **Uncertainty-Calibration Prompts:** ask model to “rate its confidence” or “explain if unsure.”
* *Lab*: Students experiment with the same prompt, each adjusting decoding parameters.
* *Discussion:* How does this affect accuracy, creativity, and control?

---

### **240–255 min | Prompt Debugging, Logging & Readability**

* **Prompt Debugging Skills:** “Why did it do that?”—tracing logic, versioning, iterative edits.
* **Prompt-Readability Practices:** making prompts clear, modular, and re-usable.
* **Prompt Libraries:** intro to shared prompt repositories for reuse.
* *Showcase:* Instructor demonstrates how a slight wording tweak can “fix” a prompt failure.
* *Quick group share:* Have students post their most confusing LLM response of the hour.

---

### **255–270 min | Recap, Homework, & Preview**

* Recap key skills: tokenization, context windows, role structure, tone/style/length controls, decoding parameters.
* **Mini-homework:**

  1. Write three prompts—one divergent, one convergent, one with explicit style/length control.
  2. Try each at two different temperature/top-p settings, note the differences.
* **Reading:** Wei et al. (2024), “Compendium of Prompt Controls.”
* **Preview:** Day 2 will go deeper into shot-based prompting and multi-persona expert workflows.

---

### **Supplementary Materials & Tech**

* **Colab/Jupyter links:** Tokenization playground, prompt anatomy template, decoding slider.
* **Reference handouts:** Prompt controls cheatsheet, common pitfalls, token count tables.

---

**By the end of Day 1:**
Every student can *explain how an LLM “sees” their prompt, how to control the prompt’s structure and style, how to set limits and steer outputs, and how to start debugging basic prompt failures.*

Let me know if you want the next day broken down just as deeply—or if you want handouts, slides, code notebooks, or exercises for any block!
