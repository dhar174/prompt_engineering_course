Absolutely! Here’s a **comprehensive, minute-by-minute Day 4 plan** for your Prompt Engineering course, as per your advanced curriculum—now progressing into structured outputs, function/tool-calling, program-aided LMs, meta-prompting, and the first hands-on pipeline challenge.

---

## **Prompt Engineering: Day 4 – Structured Outputs, Function Calling, Program-Aided Reasoning, Meta-Prompting**

**Theme:**
*Moving from plain text to structured, reliable outputs—making models work as part of real systems; connecting LLMs to code, APIs, and other tools; prompting the LLM to write and refine prompts.*

---

### **0–15 min | Recap & Day Overview**

* **Review:** Decoding/robustness, self-consistency, soft prompts from Day 3.
* **Today’s focus:** Structure, automation, and external tool integration—turning prompt engineering into the backbone of real applications.

---

### **15–45 min | Structured Output Prompting**

* **JSON-only Prompts:**

  * Why structured outputs matter for pipelines and APIs.
  * Explicit JSON format instructions; dealing with hallucinations and formatting errors.
* **Regex/Schema Guards:**

  * Validating outputs post-generation.
* *Live Demo:* Prompt that produces valid JSON; catch and fix an “unparseable” LLM output.
* **Output Moderation & Format Checking:**

  * First line of defense for downstream automation.

---

### **45–75 min | Function Calling, Tools, and API Integration**

* **OpenAI Function Calling, Mistral Tools, Anthropic Tool Use:**

  * What is function calling? When to use it.
  * Schema definition (OpenAI-style functions, JSONSchema, Pydantic, etc.).
  * Mapping prompt outputs to actual function calls/APIs.
* *Hands-On Demo:* Building a prompt that generates function parameters, then calls a simple Python function.
* **Failure Modes:**

  * What to do when function calling goes wrong (bad/missing/ambiguous output).

---

### **75–90 min | Output Validation & Retry Patterns**

* **Post-Processing:**

  * Automatic retries on invalid output.
  * Validating structured data (JSON, YAML, XML, code, etc.).
* **Tools:**

  * Pydantic/Marshmallow (Python), built-in JSON validator.
* *Mini-Lab:* Write a prompt that asks for a structured shopping list, validate with code, retry if invalid.

---

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) & Hybrid Prompting**

* **PAL (Program-Aided Language Model):**

  * Letting the LLM call external code or use “tools” for sub-tasks (e.g., Python for arithmetic).
  * Why PAL often outperforms CoT on logic-heavy tasks.
* **PAL in Practice:**

  * Prompting the model to *describe* the program, then running the code, then letting LLM read the result.
* *Hands-On Lab:* Build a PAL pipeline:

  * LLM writes code for an arithmetic problem, code is run, answer is passed back to LLM for explanation.
* **Tool-Use Prompts:**

  * Asking LLM to select tools or APIs.

---

### **135–165 min | Meta-Prompting & Prompt Chaining**

* **Meta-Prompting:**

  * LLM writes or revises prompts; use cases (automating prompt generation for new data/tasks).
* **Prompt Chaining:**

  * Output of one prompt feeds into the next (pipeline or “plan-then-act” structure).
* *Group Exercise:* Each group writes a prompt that generates a new prompt for a given task.

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–210 min | Plan-then-Act & Generate-and-Validate Patterns**

* **Plan-then-Act Prompting:**

  * Model first “plans” its steps before executing.
  * Application in workflow automation and agentic systems.
* **Generate-and-Validate:**

  * LLM generates, then validates/criticizes/filters its own outputs.
* *Lab:*

  * Prompt that first outlines steps, then generates and checks each step.

---

### **210–240 min | Prompt Chaining, Iterative Refinement, and Self-Monitoring**

* **Iterative Refinement:**

  * Feedback loops: improve output through multiple LLM “passes.”
* **Self-Monitoring Prompts:**

  * Asking LLM to reflect: “Was my last answer correct? Why or why not?”
* *Demo & Exercise:*

  * Create a simple pipeline with two LLM calls—first to solve, second to check/critique and revise if necessary.

---

### **240–255 min | Real-World Application Challenge**

* **Pipeline Mini-Project Launch:**

  * Students start building a micro-app that uses structured output, function-calling, and at least one plan-then-act or validation loop.
  * Deliverable for Day 6: working pipeline with logging and error-handling.
* **Troubleshooting Tips:**

  * Common problems: parsing errors, failed calls, logic bugs in plans.

---

### **255–270 min | Recap, Homework, & Preview**

* **Recap:**

  * Structured output prompting, function/tool calling, PAL, prompt chaining, meta-prompting, validation/retry.
* **Homework:**

  1. Draft and refine a prompt for a real-world task that requires structured output (JSON or YAML).
  2. Write a meta-prompt (prompt that generates prompts) for a new data extraction scenario.
  3. Try the “plan-then-act” template on a complex instruction and document failures/successes.
* **Preview:**

  * Day 5: Advanced reasoning—CoT, Tree-/Graph-/Contrastive-CoT, Reflexion, self-critique, and generate/validate strategies.

---

### **Supplementary Materials**

* **Colab Notebooks:**

  * JSON/regex prompt templates, function-calling skeleton, PAL/plan-then-act pipeline demos.
* **Handouts:**

  * Structured output checklist, validation/retry cheat sheet, PAL and prompt chaining pattern cards.

---

**By end of Day 4:**
Students will be able to create prompts for structured output, automate API or tool use, build basic prompt pipelines, prompt the model to write/validate prompts, and set up plan-execute workflows.
They’ll be ready for advanced reasoning patterns and multi-step agentic tasks on Day 5.
