## **Prompt Engineering: Day 9 – Pipelines, Agents, Orchestration, and the Tools Ecosystem**

**Theme:**
*Taking prompt engineering to production: chaining, orchestrating, scaling, deploying, monitoring, and integrating with the full LLM tool and agent ecosystem.*

---

### **0–15 min | Recap & Day Overview**

* **Review:** Security, robustness, alignment, adversarial defense from Day 8.
* **Today’s focus:** Connecting everything—multi-step pipelines, multi-agent systems, logging/monitoring, production deployment, and the “tool zoo.”

---

### **15–45 min | Prompt Pipelines: Chaining & Orchestration**

* **Prompt Chaining:**

  * Linking outputs of one prompt/task as inputs for the next.
  * Modular and reusable design (refresher on modular prompt blocks).
* **Workflow Patterns:**

  * State-machine, graph, and DAG orchestration for complex tasks.
* **Hands-On Demo:**

  * Build a chained prompt workflow: e.g., retrieve data → summarize → fact-check → format output.
* **Exercise:**

  * Students sketch a pipeline for a multi-step task in their own domain.

---

### **45–75 min | Multi-Agent Prompting and Agent Frameworks**

* **Multi-Agent Prompt Chaining:**

  * Architectures for distributed problem-solving; collaboration, delegation, and role division among LLM “agents.”
* **Agentic Prompting Patterns:**

  * How to design prompt protocols for negotiation, memory, and iterative improvement.
* **Agent Frameworks:**

  * **AutoGPT, BabyAGI, Flowise, Semantic Kernel:** features, best uses, and practical demo.
* **Live Lab:**

  * Small teams design and run a two-agent workflow (e.g., Q\&A + critique; researcher + summarizer).

---

### **75–90 min | Prompt Orchestration with LangChain, LlamaIndex & Friends**

* **LangChain Framework:**

  * Core building blocks (Chains, Agents, Tools, Memory, Retrievers, Output Parsers).
  * Demo: Building and debugging a LangChain “chain.”
* **LlamaIndex:**

  * Indexing and query abstraction for retrieval-augmented workflows.
* **Other Tools:**

  * Gradio/Streamlit (UI), PromptLayer (logging), OpenPrompt/promptIDE (prompt management), Humanloop/Promptist (optimization/experimentation).
* **Quick Hits:**

  * PromptHub, LangChain Hub, LLMHub: sharing, benchmarking, and reusing prompt assets.

---

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Monitoring, Logging, Analytics, and Versioning**

* **PromptLayer Analytics:**

  * Trace, monitor, and analyze prompt executions at scale.
* **Logging and Observability:**

  * What to log: inputs, outputs, context, versioning, error/failure cases.
* **Prompt Versioning:**

  * How to track improvements and A/B tests over time.
* **Demo:**

  * Instructor sets up PromptLayer logging for a chained workflow.

---

### **135–165 min | Deployment Patterns, Scaling, and Large-Scale Prompting**

* **Deployment Strategies:**

  * Serving prompt-driven apps at scale: REST APIs, microservices, serverless.
* **Scaling Issues:**

  * Latency, cost, context-window management, prompt efficiency at high volume.
* **Production Tooling:**

  * Monitoring, alerting, rollback, CI/CD for prompt engineering.
* **Group Exercise:**

  * Students plan a deployment/scale-up scenario for their capstone or mini-project.

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–210 min | Automated Evaluation & Reward Models**

* **Automated Prompt Evaluation:**

  * Integrating evals and benchmarks into the pipeline.
* **OpenAI Evals, FormatSpread, PromptEval, LMHarness, HELM:**

  * Quick tour and hands-on with at least one framework.
* **Reward Models in the Loop:**

  * Use cases for PRM/ORM in pipeline optimization.
* **Hands-On:**

  * Add a prompt evaluation step to a workflow, log results.

---

### **210–240 min | Real-World Pipeline/Agent Project Sprint**

* **Lab Sprint:**

  * Build (or extend) a pipeline or agentic app that chains prompts, logs outputs, and is ready for evaluation.
  * Teams/individuals iterate on their RAG, agent, or domain-specific mini-projects.
* **Peer Review:**

  * Teams test each other’s apps, suggest improvements, and report on pipeline robustness.

---

### **240–255 min | Ecosystem Quickfire: Tools, Platforms, Repos**

* **Lightning Demos:**

  * OpenPrompt, promptIDE, PromptHub, Humanloop, Promptist, LLMHub, and any major new platforms since 2024.
* **Best Practices:**

  * How to choose, combine, and future-proof your toolchain.
* **Open Discussion:**

  * Students share their favorite tools/platforms and how they’ve integrated them into projects.

---

### **255–270 min | Recap, Homework, & Preview**

* **Recap:**

  * Chaining, orchestration, multi-agent, logging, monitoring, tools, deployment.
* **Homework:**

  1. Finalize your capstone pipeline or agent project, including versioning and logging.
  2. Run at least one automated evaluation/benchmark.
  3. Prepare a short demo/presentation for Day 11.
* **Preview:**

  * Day 10: Evaluation, metrics, A/B testing, adversarial benchmarking, and full-circle on robustness and optimization.

---

### **Supplementary Materials**

* **Colab/Notebook Labs:**

  * LangChain/LlamaIndex pipeline templates, PromptLayer logging script, agentic workflow sample.
* **Handouts:**

  * Pipeline design patterns, deployment checklist, tool ecosystem map.
