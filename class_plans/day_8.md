## **Prompt Engineering: Day 8 – Security, Alignment, Ethics, and Adversarial Robustness**

**Theme:**
*How to attack, defend, and align prompts and LLM-powered systems. Master the risks, patch the holes, document compliance, and engineer responsible, robust prompt-driven applications.*

---

### **0–15 min | Recap & Day Overview**

* **Review:** Advanced/automated prompting, soft/embedding/negative, and multilingual from Day 7.
* **Today’s focus:** Security, robustness, bias, privacy, regulatory and ethical prompting—plus hands-on adversarial practice.

---

### **15–45 min | Prompt Injection & Jailbreak Taxonomy**

* **Prompt Injection Attacks (General, Direct, Indirect/Context):**

  * How attackers “leak,” override, or subvert prompts.
* **Token-Smuggling Attacks:**

  * Tricks with delimiters, unicode, encoding, etc.
* **Prompt-Leaking Risk:**

  * Unintentional exposure of sensitive system or user prompt content.
* **Jailbreaking Techniques & Content-Filter Evasion:**

  * Real-world attacks and defenses.
* **Demo:**

  * Show live prompt injection and jailbreak on a test system.

---

### **45–75 min | Prompt Guardrails, Isolation, and Input/Output Moderation**

* **Prompt-Isolation Strategy:**

  * Preventing “role confusion” and lateral prompt movement.
* **Input Sanitization:**

  * Filtering or rejecting dangerous/ambiguous user inputs.
* **Output Moderation:**

  * Ensuring safe, non-toxic, and non-leaky responses (OpenAI/Anthropic/LLM toolkits).
* **Live Lab:**

  * Students each attack and then defend a toy chatbot with prompt injection and isolation.
* **OWASP LLM Top-10 Compliance:**

  * Checklist and what it means for prompt engineering.

---

### **75–90 min | Bias, Alignment, and Constitutional Prompts**

* **Bias-Mitigation Prompting:**

  * Steering away from stereotypes and harmful content.
* **Constitutional-AI Alignment Prompts:**

  * Using rulebooks and policy prompts (Anthropic, OpenAI techniques).
* **Transparency & Explainability Prompts:**

  * Prompting models to “show their work,” explain outputs, or justify decisions.
* **Mini-Exercise:**

  * Write a transparency prompt for a sensitive or regulated task (e.g., hiring, admissions).

---

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Regulatory, Privacy & Consent Prompts**

* **Privacy-and-Consent Prompts:**

  * Asking, tracking, and logging consent; handling PII.
* **Safety-Instruction Prompts:**

  * Enforcing safety constraints directly in prompts (e.g., “Never give medical advice…”).
* **Regulatory-Compliance Prompts:**

  * EU AI Act, US NIST, other compliance frameworks—how to encode requirements into prompt logic.
* **Responsible-AI Prompts:**

  * Nudging for beneficial, non-manipulative, truthful outputs.
* *Lab:*

  * Engineer a “regulation-compliant” prompt for a high-risk application.

---

### **135–165 min | Adversarial Robustness, Logging & Versioning**

* **Prompt Robustness Adversarial Testing:**

  * Red-teaming: how to actively “break” prompts, then patch them.
* **Failure-Case Logging & Prompt Versioning:**

  * Track, fix, document—close the loop between discovery and improvement.
* **PromptLayer Analytics:**

  * Log, trace, and monitor prompt-driven applications.
* **Demo:**

  * Instructor walks through a live adversarial test and “version upgrade” cycle.

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–210 min | Hands-On: Red Team vs Blue Team Prompt Engineering**

* **Red Team:**

  * Try to bypass, confuse, or jailbreak another group’s prompts.
* **Blue Team:**

  * Patch, defend, and document fixes.
* **Reporting:**

  * Each team submits a log of attacks and mitigations (graded for creativity, effectiveness, and clarity).
* **Discussion:**

  * Most creative attack? Hardest to defend? What tools and tactics worked best?

---

### **210–240 min | Advanced Topics & Quick Hits**

* **Content-Filter Evasion:**

  * Evasion tactics and “cat-and-mouse” escalation.
* **Persuasive Prompting Ethics:**

  * Responsible use of persuasive/recommendation prompts (ads, politics, etc.).
* **Transparency, Explainability & Responsible-AI Recap:**

  * How to future-proof prompt design for new risks.
* **Lightning Talks:**

  * Each group presents a “risk and mitigation” from today’s practice.

---

### **240–255 min | Toolkits & Practical Defenses**

* **Showcase:**

  * Real tools for robust prompt deployment (OpenAI moderation, Anthropic filters, Microsoft Azure, PromptLayer, etc.).
* **Quick Demo:**

  * Set up moderation or logging with a real API or open-source toolkit.
* **Checklists:**

  * OWASP, privacy-by-design, and responsible-AI resources.

---

### **255–270 min | Recap, Homework & Preview**

* **Recap:**

  * Prompt attack/defense taxonomy, isolation, moderation, compliance, adversarial logging, toolkits.
* **Homework:**

  1. Submit a before/after example of a prompt you hardened against attack, with a “threat model.”
  2. Write and test a compliance-focused or privacy-preserving prompt for your mini-project.
* **Preview:**

  * Day 9: Integrating pipelines—multi-agent, prompt orchestration, logging, large-scale deployment, tool ecosystem “zoo,” and agentic prompt engineering.

---

### **Supplementary Materials**

* **Labs:**

  * Red/blue team scenario sheet, prompt attack/defense playground.
* **Handouts:**

  * Compliance and bias prompt patterns, moderation/API guides, robust prompt checklist.
* **Links:**

  * OWASP LLM Top-10, EU AI Act, NIST AI Risk docs, PromptLayer docs, Responsible-AI frameworks.

**By end of Day 8:**
Students will have directly attacked and defended real prompt-driven systems, documented and mitigated risks, engineered prompts for privacy, compliance, and safety, and explored toolkits for robust and ethical prompt deployments.
