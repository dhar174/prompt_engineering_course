Absolutely! Here’s a **fully detailed, skillfully integrated Day 2 lesson plan** for your Prompt Engineering course, expanding on foundational controls to cover prompt patterns (zero/one/few-shot), role/persona, expert prompting, multi-persona scenarios, template use, readability, and collaborative design—all with direct coverage of the remaining catalogue items.

## **Prompt Engineering: Day 2 – Foundational Prompt Patterns & Persona Workflows**

**Theme:**
*From single-turn instructions to structured, multi-example, multi-persona prompts. Building reusable prompt templates, managing clarity, and learning collaborative prompt design best practices.*

---

### **0–15 min | Recap & Day Overview**

* Recap key Day 1 skills: tokenization, controls, style, length, decoding.
* Today’s focus: “prompt patterns” (zero/one/few-shot), role/persona, template engineering, prompt readability, collaborative design.

---

### **15–45 min | Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot Prompting**

* **Zero-Shot Prompting:** When and why it works/doesn’t.
* **Instruction-Based Prompting:** Explicit directions.
* **In-Context Learning:** Model’s “memory” of what’s shown.
* **One-Shot Prompting:** Adding a single example.
* **Few-Shot Prompting:** Multiple demonstrations; impact of order/variety.
* *Live Demo:* Show differences in model output for a task at each “shot” level.

---

### **45–60 min | Prompt Template Engineering**

* **Prompt Templates:** How to structure for re-use (placeholders, system/user/assistant roles).
* **Contextual Prompting:** Including relevant background/context.
* **System/User/Assistant Segregation:** Best practices for role-delimited prompts.
* **Prompt Libraries:** Intro to shared prompt repositories; versioning.
* *Exercise:* Students fill in a blank template to accomplish a real task.

---

### **60–90 min | Role, Persona, and Expert Prompting**

* **Role / Persona Prompting:** Stepping into a character (e.g., “You are a psychologist”).
* **Expert Prompting:** “Act as an expert in…” for authoritative output.
* **Multi-Persona Prompting:** Multi-character scenarios (doctor & patient, manager & employee).
* **Role-Play Prompting:** Dialogue-driven prompts for simulation/training.
* *Live Demo:* Instructor plays out a doctor/patient and lawyer/client scenario.
* *Quick Exercise:* Students try their own two-persona prompt.

---

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Word/Character Limits, Tone, Formality, Reading Level**

* **Word / Character-Limit Control:** Forcing concise or verbose output.
* **Tone / Style Constraints:** Revisited in the context of shot-based patterns and personas.
* **Formal vs Informal Output:** Comparing effects on model outputs.
* **Reading-Level Adjustment:** Making prompts that produce output suitable for specific audiences.
* *Lab*: “Rewrite this answer as a formal executive summary… Now for a 5th grader… Now as a pirate.”
* *Group Share:* Post and review most successful/funny/clear prompt rewrites.

---

### **135–165 min | Prompt Readability & Collaborative Design**

* **Prompt-Readability Practices:** Formatting, delimiters, modular prompts.
* **Collaborative Prompt Design:** Pair & group work, version sharing, constructive critique.
* *Exercise:* Groups each improve a “bad” prompt—identify what’s unclear, fix it together, and test both versions.
* *Discussion:* Prompting for collaboration: how clear prompts foster better teamwork in LLM projects.

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–210 min | Modular Prompt Engineering & Prompt Libraries**

* **Modular Prompt-Engineering:** Building reusable building blocks.
* **Shared Repositories:** Contributing to and borrowing from community libraries.
* *Instructor Demo:* How to structure prompt “blocks” for flexible re-use (e.g., context + instruction + example + output schema).
* *Exercise:* Each student builds a modular template for a chosen task.

---

### **210–240 min | Real-World Prompt Patterns**

* **Case Studies:**

  * Real-world applications: chatbots, tutoring, email triage, customer support.
  * Multi-turn interactions: sustaining context over multiple prompts.
* **Example Walkthroughs:** Students analyze successful prompts from open repositories.

---

### **240–255 min | Advanced Persona/Role-Play Challenge**

* **Challenge Lab:**

  * Create a 3-persona scenario (e.g., patient, nurse, specialist).
  * Assign tone, reading level, and length limits for each role.
  * Run and share output in the class chat.
* *Discussion:* What worked? What failed? (Tie back to debugging skills.)

---

### **255–270 min | Recap, Homework & Preview**

* **Recap:**

  * Shot-based prompting (zero/one/few), role/persona, expert, templates, readability, collaboration.
* **Homework:**

  1. Write three prompts: (a) expert persona, (b) multi-persona role-play, (c) reusable template.
  2. Test each with two different tone/length/readability controls.
  3. Save and submit “before and after” readability improvements.
* **Preview:**

  * Day 3 covers decoding, self-consistency, uncertainty, failure logging, and a primer on soft-prompting.

---

### **Supplementary Materials**

* **Colab links:** Prompt pattern playgrounds, persona template library.
* **Handouts:** Prompt pattern cheatsheet, template formatting guide, sample prompt repository access.

---

**By end of Day 2:**
Students can design, analyze, and debug basic and complex prompt patterns, manipulate persona and expert roles, enforce clarity and tone, and collaborate on prompt engineering in a professional, reproducible way.
