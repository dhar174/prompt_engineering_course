Absolutely! Here’s a **detailed, comprehensive lesson plan for Day 6** of your Prompt Engineering course, fully aligned with your catalogue and curriculum structure. This day focuses on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), knowledge-based and domain-specific prompting, graph-based retrieval, user/persona adaptation, and multimodal/real-world data techniques. It also covers long-term consistency, no-code/low-code prompt engineering, and the start of a substantial RAG-based project.

## **Prompt Engineering: Day 6 – Retrieval-Augmented, Domain-Specific, Graph-Based & Personalized Prompting**

**Theme:**
*Integrating external data and knowledge into prompts; building more robust, context-aware, and user-specific LLM applications using RAG, graph-based, and adaptive/personalized prompting. Moving toward multimodal and production-grade workflows.*

---

### **0–15 min | Recap & Day Overview**

* **Review:** Advanced reasoning (CoT/ToT/GoT, meta-prompting, self-critique) from Day 5.
* **Today’s focus:** Connecting LLMs with real knowledge—retrieval, domain-adaptation, user modeling, and more.

---

### **15–45 min | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Fundamentals**

* **Concept:**

  * What is RAG? Why is it essential for production LLMs?
  * How retrieval fixes hallucination, extends context, and enables up-to-date answers.
* **Embedding-Based Retrieval Prompting:**

  * Vector search basics (FAISS/Chroma), embedding models.
* **Hands-On Demo:**

  * Query, retrieve, insert into prompt, and observe difference in LLM output.
* *Q\&A:* When to use RAG vs. classic prompting.

---

### **45–75 min | Knowledge-Base, Database & Document QA Prompting**

* **Knowledge-Base/Database Integration Prompts:**

  * Connecting to business or scientific knowledge stores; query design.
* **Document QA Prompts:**

  * Handling long documents, PDFs, and structured files.
* **Live Example:**

  * Pulling answers from real docs (e.g., company policies, scientific articles).
* **Prompt Engineering for QA:**

  * How to format context; chunking, context window, fallback strategies.

---

### **75–90 min | GraphRAG & Graph-Based Retrieval**

* **GraphRAG:**

  * Graph-based retrieval for richer, relational, or hierarchical data.
  * When is GraphRAG superior to vanilla RAG?
* **External Knowledge-Graph Prompts:**

  * Using ontologies, schemas, or knowledge graphs.
* **Hands-On Exercise:**

  * Simple knowledge graph demo (e.g., Neo4j, networkx, or LangChain KG module).
* *Group brainstorm:* Which use cases benefit most from graph-based retrieval?

---

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Domain-Specific Prompt Templates & Adaptation**

* **Domain-Specific Prompt Templates:**

  * Adapting prompts for legal, medical, scientific, customer support, etc.
* **Prompt Compression & Summarization:**

  * When data/context is too long; automatic and prompt-driven summarization.
* **Multilingual/Cross-Lingual Prompting:**

  * Adapting retrieval and prompts for other languages.
* **Lab:**

  * Students each pick a domain and adapt a template for that field.

---

### **135–165 min | Personalized, Adaptive, and User-Profiling Prompts**

* **Personalized Prompting:**

  * User history, preferences, personalization strategies.
* **User-Profiling Prompts:**

  * Building user models to steer prompts dynamically.
* **Adaptive Personal Agents:**

  * Simple recommendation bots, assistants, or guides.
* **Long-Term-Consistency Prompts:**

  * Keeping facts, style, and context stable across sessions.
* **Group Exercise:**

  * Teams sketch a “personalized RAG chatbot” with user-profile adaptation.

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–210 min | Multimodal, Sensor, Audio/Video, and Real-World Data Prompting**

* **Multimodal Prompting:**

  * Combining text, images, tables, charts, and more.
* **Multimodal Chain-of-Thought:**

  * Reasoning across text + image or other media.
* **Audio/Video + Text Prompting:**

  * Example: Speech-to-text as input, or using image analysis as context.
* **Sensor/Real-World Data Prompting:**

  * Examples from IoT, real-time dashboards, and process control.
* **Lab:**

  * Use a Colab notebook with at least two modalities in a prompt.

---

### **210–240 min | No-Code / Low-Code Prompt Engineering**

* **No-Code/Low-Code Prompt Engineering:**

  * Platforms: Gradio, Streamlit, Flowise, visual prompt editors.
* **Demo:**

  * Build a simple RAG or chatbot workflow visually (no code).
* **Discussion:**

  * Pros, cons, and limitations of no-code approaches for real production needs.

---

### **240–255 min | Mini-Project Kickoff: RAG or Domain-Specific Chatbot**

* **Assignment Launch:**

  * Each student/team starts a RAG-powered or domain-personalized chatbot/project.
  * *Requirements*: Must use retrieval (vector or graph), have a domain template, and at least one personalized or multimodal component.
* **Support:**

  * TAs available for platform setup, vector DB selection, and tool integration.

---

### **255–270 min | Recap, Homework & Preview**

* **Recap:**

  * RAG, graph-based retrieval, domain templates, user adaptation, multimodal, no-code tools.
* **Homework:**

  1. Draft a domain-specific RAG prompt and test with at least two different data sources.
  2. Design a personalized or user-profiling prompt for your project.
  3. Submit a short summary of your planned mini-project (due Day 9).
* **Preview:**

  * Day 7: Deep-dive into soft, prefix, and embedding-based prompting, including state-of-the-art automated prompt optimization, negative prompting, and multilingual/cross-lingual prompt techniques.
