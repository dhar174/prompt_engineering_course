# Sample Document: Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

## Key Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: classification, regression
- Common algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Common algorithms: k-means, PCA, autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses reward and punishment system
- Examples: game playing, robotics, autonomous vehicles

## Applications

Machine learning is used in:
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles
