## **Prompt Engineering: Day 7 – Soft, Tuned, and Embedding-Based Prompting; Multilingual & Automated Techniques**

**Theme:**
*How to push prompting beyond plain text: learn soft prompts, prompt tuning, gradient-based methods, automated search, and prompt evolution. Also, explore cross-lingual prompts, negative/textual inversion, and the latest research in prompt optimization.*

---

### **0–15 min | Recap & Day Overview**

* **Review:** RAG, domain adaptation, multimodal, no-code tools from Day 6.
* **Today’s focus:** Pushing the boundaries—customizing prompts “below the surface” and automating prompt improvement.

---

### **15–45 min | Soft Prompting, Prompt Tuning & Prefix/P-Tuning**

* **What is Soft Prompting?**

  * Difference between “soft” (embedding-based) and classic prompts.
* **Prompt Tuning & Prefix Tuning:**

  * How gradient-based prompt tuning works (training prompt tokens, not model weights).
* **P-Tuning:**

  * P-Tuning v1/v2, pros and cons.
* **Use Cases:**

  * When soft/prefix tuning makes a difference (e.g., ultra-low-data, high-precision domains).
* **Live Demo:**

  * Visualizing soft prompt tokens and running a simple prompt-tuned model (use HuggingFace/Colab or off-the-shelf demo).
* *Q\&A*: When is text not enough?

---

### **45–75 min | Advanced Soft & Automated Prompting Techniques**

* **AutoPrompt (Gradient-Based):**

  * Using model gradients to discover prompt tokens automatically.
* **OPRO (One-Prompt Reasoning Optimization):**

  * Latest research from Google Brain/OpenAI; optimizing for reasoning outcomes.
* **Auto-CoT:**

  * Automated search for optimal chain-of-thought prompts.
* **APE/APET (Automatic/Autonomous Prompt Engineer Toolbox):**

  * Tools that automate prompt search, evaluation, and selection.
* **Active-Prompt & Prompt-OIRL:**

  * Advanced methods for active learning, online improvement.
* **Continuous Prompt Evolution:**

  * Evolving prompts over time, adapting to changing data or needs.
* **Demo:**

  * Show a simple AutoPrompt or OPRO run on a small model (or code walkthrough).

### **75–90 min | Embedding-Based Prompting and Retrieval**

* **Embedding-Based Retrieval Prompting:**

  * In-depth, vector search, semantic retrieval, and context window optimization.
* **Integration with RAG/GraphRAG:**

  * When and how to blend with soft/embedding prompts.
* *Lab:*

  * Students build a hybrid prompt that combines classic and embedding-based retrieval.

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Prompting**

* **Multilingual Prompt Engineering:**

  * Techniques, pitfalls, and best practices for working across languages.
* **Cross-Lingual Prompting:**

  * Prompting in one language, output in another; translation/retrieval pipelines.
* **Live Demo:**

  * Prompt a multilingual model for a task in English, Spanish, and Chinese.
* **Lab:**

  * Translate and adapt a prompt template for three languages; run and compare outputs.
* *Discussion*: How well do prompt patterns transfer across languages?

---

### **135–165 min | Negative Prompting, Textual Inversion, and Diffusion Models**

* **Negative Prompting (text-to-image):**

  * Telling the model what NOT to generate (especially for diffusion/SD models).
* **Textual Inversion:**

  * Training new “concepts” as prompt tokens for generative models.
* **Demo:**

  * Visual/Colab demo: negative prompting with SDXL or a similar image model.
* *Group Exercise:*

  * Each group picks a “forbidden” or “new” concept and tries to create or block it via prompts.

* **Demo:**

  * Automated search tool (e.g., APET or HuggingFace Accelerate Prompt Search).
* *Lightning Talk:*

  * The “AI-as-Prompt-Engineer” paradigm—where are we headed?
