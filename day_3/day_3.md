Absolutely! Here is a **comprehensive, step-by-step plan for Day 3**, following your integrated curriculum and making sure to directly address all key decoding, sampling, and self-consistency concepts from your catalogue. This day sets the groundwork for deeper prompt optimization, with plenty of hands-on lab work and debugging.

---

## **Prompt Engineering: Day 3 – Decoding, Sampling, Self-Consistency & Uncertainty**

**Theme:**
*How decoding strategies, sampling controls, and uncertainty calibration shape the output space of LLMs; how to debug, version, and monitor prompt performance.*

---

### **0–15 min | Recap & Day Overview**

* **Quick review:** Shot-based prompting, template design, role/persona work, readability from Day 2.
* **Today’s focus:** How outputs are *sampled*; how to control and evaluate diversity, determinism, and reliability in model responses.

---

### **15–45 min | Deterministic vs. Stochastic Decoding**

* **Deterministic Decoding:** Greedy search, beam search (brief intro), implications for predictable outputs.
* **Stochastic Decoding:** Sampling, randomness, how and when to use it.
* **Live Demo:** Compare a simple prompt using greedy vs. sampling vs. beam search on the same model.
* **Group Discussion:** What type of applications need deterministic vs. diverse outputs?

---

### **45–75 min | Decoding Parameters & Output Diversity**

* **Temperature Modulation:** From monotone to wild outputs; what temperature does “under the hood.”
* **Top-k & Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling:** Direct impact on creativity and accuracy.
* **Presence & Frequency Penalties:** Taming repetition; penalizing overused words/phrases.
* **Logit Bias:** Advanced: how to bias the model towards or away from specific outputs.
* *Hands-On Lab:* Each student runs the same base prompt at three settings (low temp, high temp, high top-p).
* *Q\&A:* When might you want “safe” vs “creative” outputs?

---

### **75–90 min | Output Length & Control Parameters**

* **Max Tokens Setting:** Forcing brevity or expansion; role in controlling costs.
* **Prompt Debugging:** How to spot when a prompt “runs off the rails” due to decoding.
* *Quick Exercise:* Write a prompt that must answer in <15 words using explicit token/word control and decoding settings.

---

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Self-Consistency Decoding & Uncertainty Calibration**

* **Self-Consistency Decoding:** Generate multiple completions; select the most common or plausible.
* **Self-Consistency in Practice:** CoT/ToT arithmetic problems; majority-vote answer selection.
* **Uncertainty-Calibration Prompts:** Prompt the model to rate or explain its confidence (“If unsure, say ‘I am unsure’”).
* *Lab:* Each student runs a reasoning prompt three times, logs different outputs, and tries a “majority rule.”
* **Self-Explanation Prompts:** Instructing the model to show/explain its reasoning process; why this increases reliability.
* *Discussion:* When is it useful to ask for uncertainty or explanation? (safety, quality, user trust)

---

### **135–165 min | Prompt Robustness & Failure Logging**

* **Prompt Robustness Score:** What makes a prompt “fragile” vs. “robust.”
* **Failure-Case Logging:** Tracking prompt failures for later debugging.
* **Prompt Versioning:** Why and how to track incremental changes (naming, version numbers, storing in prompt libraries).
* *Demo:* Instructor introduces a “prompt versioning” Google Sheet / Git repo; how to document and analyze prompt changes.
* *Exercise:* Students pick a failed prompt from earlier, revise, and log the fix.

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–210 min | Intro to Soft Prompting & Prompt Tuning (Conceptual Teaser)**

* **Soft Prompting, Prefix-Tuning, P-Tuning:**

  * What are they?
  * Why do they matter (especially for power users and researchers)?
* **Demo:** Visualizing a “prompt embedding” and why it’s different from textual prompts.
* **Catalog Reference:** Soft/embedding-based approaches in LLM toolkits.
* *Q\&A:* Which problems are better solved with prompt tuning vs. template engineering?

---

### **210–240 min | Lab: Decoding Strategies in the Real World**

* **Lab Challenge:**

  * Use a creative writing prompt and a math problem prompt.
  * Run with different temperature, top-k, top-p settings, and self-consistency decoding.
  * Log and compare: Which settings give more diversity? Which increase accuracy?
* **Analysis:**

  * Group shares: Surprising outputs? Errors that only showed up at one setting?
  * Discuss how sampling and decoding are critical for both safe and creative production.

---

### **240–255 min | Prompt Debugging & Readability in Depth**

* **Debugging Recap:** Quick look at failure analysis: “Is the problem the prompt, the model, or the decoding?”
* **Prompt-Readability Practices:** Formatting for clarity and modularity, especially when using complex decoding.
* **Prompt Libraries:** Importance of saving successful patterns and failure cases for future reference.

---

### **255–270 min | Recap, Homework & Preview**

* **Recap:**

  * Deterministic vs. stochastic decoding
  * Sampling parameters (temp, top-k, top-p)
  * Self-consistency decoding
  * Prompt robustness, logging, and versioning
  * Intro to soft prompts and tuning
* **Homework:**

  1. Write three prompts (math, creative, classification) and test at three different decoding settings each.
  2. Document any failures and submit with a proposed revision.
* **Preview:**

  * Day 4: Structured outputs (JSON, regex), function-calling, PAL, meta-prompting, and program-aided reasoning.

---

### **Supplementary Materials**

* **Colab/Jupyter Notebooks:**

  * Decoding playground (temperature/top-k/top-p sliders)
  * Self-consistency and uncertainty demo code
  * Prompt versioning template (Google Sheets or Git)
* **Handouts:**

  * Decoding cheat sheet (temp/top-k/top-p explained)
  * Failure logging template

---

**By end of Day 3:**
Students will understand how LLM outputs are generated and controlled, how to systematically test and debug prompts, how to start tracking prompt versions and failures, and how advanced “soft” prompts fit into the landscape.
