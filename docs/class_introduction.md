# Welcome to the Prompt Engineering Course

This short guide introduces you to the structure of the course and how to get the most from the repository.

## Why Learn Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting clear, targeted instructions for language models. A well‑designed prompt can turn a generic model into a focused assistant, research aide, or creative partner.

## Course Format
- **Hands‑on notebooks**: Experiment directly with prompts in Jupyter notebooks.
- **Reference documents**: Read concise guides on best practices and common pitfalls.
- **Sample code**: Explore reusable snippets and utilities for your own projects.

Each module builds on the previous one, so we recommend working through the lessons in order.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository and install the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Open the notebooks in the `day_*` folders to follow along with the exercises.
3. Review the `docs` directory for supplemental readings and cheat sheets.

## Contributing
We welcome improvements! If you discover an issue or have an idea for additional material, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
