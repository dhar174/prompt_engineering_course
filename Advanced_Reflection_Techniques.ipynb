    "1. **Explain** what “reflection” means for LLMs and why it improves reliability.  \n",
    "2. **Compare** baseline prompting with several *advanced* reflection patterns (Self‑Critique, Reflexion, Critic‑Assistant, etc.).  \n",
    "3. **Implement** a two‑pass self‑evaluation loop using the OpenAI API (or a local model).  \n",
    "4. **Design & run** multi‑turn reflection pipelines that automatically retry or revise answers.  \n",
    "5. **Measure** quality gains with simple programmatic or LLM‑based evaluators.  \n",
    "6. **Extend** the templates provided here to new tasks (summarisation, coding, reasoning).  \n"

    "## 1  Why Reflection?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs often generate the *first* plausible answer that satisfies the probability distribution, but that answer isn’t always correct or safe.  \n",
    "**Reflection** adds one or more deliberate *metacognitive* steps in which the model (or a helper agent) re‑reads, critiques, and revises its own output.\n",

    "Typical benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Higher factual accuracy & fewer “silly” mistakes  \n",
    "* Better chain‑of‑thought transparency for debugging  \n",
    "* A natural hook for tool‑calling (tests, linters, content policies)  \n",
