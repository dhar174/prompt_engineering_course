Here you go—a detailed, minute-by-minute plan for **Day 5**. This day is a major leap in reasoning complexity, covering *all* Chain-of-Thought (CoT) variants, advanced multi-step prompting, meta-reasoning, and a suite of reflection/self-critique strategies, as well as generate-and-validate workflows. All relevant concepts from your catalogue are covered explicitly.

## **Prompt Engineering: Day 5 – The Chain-of-Thought Galaxy & Advanced Reasoning Patterns**

**Theme:**
*How to elicit, structure, and optimize complex reasoning and multi-step problem solving from LLMs. From classic CoT to cutting-edge variants, plus meta-prompting, self-evaluation, and the emergence of “thinking about thinking.”*

---

### **0–15 min | Recap & Day Overview**

* Review: Structured outputs, function-calling, PAL, meta-prompting, chaining from Day 4.
* Today: Advanced reasoning and reflection—*how* models think, plan, and critique.

---

### **15–45 min | Classic & Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**

* **Classic CoT Prompting:**

  * “Let’s think step by step.”
  * When it works, when it fails.
* **Zero-Shot CoT:**

  * Inducing reasoning from pure instruction.
* *Live Demo:* Math word problems with/without CoT.
* *Discussion:* Why showing “thinking” often boosts accuracy.

---

### **45–60 min | Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and Variants**

* **Few-Shot CoT:**

  * Including step-by-step exemplars.
* **Self-Consistency Decoding:**

  * Generating multiple rationales, picking most common.
* **Contrastive CoT:**

  * Prompting for *contradictory* or “think of an alternative” reasoning for error reduction.
* *Mini-lab:* Students try two ways to solve the same problem with CoT vs. alternative approach.

---

### **60–90 min | Tree-of-Thoughts, Graph-of-Thoughts, & ToT/GoT Algorithms**

* **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT):**

  * Branching reasoning, backtracking.
* **Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT):**

  * Flexible, multi-path reasoning, parallel exploration.
* **Practical Applications:**

  * Planning, game-solving, coding agents.
* *Whiteboard Demo:* Visualizing CoT, ToT, GoT on real examples.
* *Exercise:* Students diagram a simple ToT/GoT for a logic puzzle.

---

### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | ReAct, Plan-then-Act, Program-Aided Reasoning**

* **ReAct Prompting (Reason + Act):**

  * Interleaving “thought” and “action” steps.
* **Plan-then-Act Prompting:**

  * First, list steps; then execute each in turn.
* **Program-Aided CoT (PAL, revisited):**

  * Code as reasoning sub-routine; hybrid “model + tool” planning.
* *Hands-on Demo:* Students build a prompt for a research agent using Plan-then-Act and/or ReAct structure.

---

### **135–165 min | Meta-Prompting, Reflexion, and Self-Critique**

* **Meta-Prompting:**

  * LLM creates/refines its own reasoning prompts.
* **Reflexion Technique:**

  * Self-critique: “Was my answer correct? Why or why not?”
* **Self-Explanation & Post-hoc Reflection:**

  * Ask the model to justify or reflect on its steps and output.
* **Iterative Reflection:**

  * Re-running tasks with additional “reflective” passes.
* *Lab:*

  * Write a prompt that asks the LLM to critique, then retry its own answer.
  * Group discussion: What kinds of errors are caught this way?

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–210 min | Generate-and-Validate, Iterative Refinement, Uncertainty Calibration**

* **Generate-and-Validate Prompts:**

  * LLM generates, then a second prompt or model validates or filters.
* **Iterative Refinement:**

  * Feedback loop: continue refining output until validation passes.
* **Uncertainty Calibration:**

  * Prompt LLM to indicate confidence (“How sure are you?”).
* *Hands-On Exercise:* Students set up a two-stage prompt: generate answer, then validate or self-critique, and repeat if needed.

---

### **210–240 min | Real-World Multi-Step Reasoning Challenge**

* **Challenge:**

  * Build a prompt pipeline for a complex multi-step task (e.g., multi-hop QA, puzzle, planning).
  * Must combine CoT, validation, and reflection/self-critique in one chain.
* *Share & Debug:* Small groups swap pipelines, try to “break” each other’s workflows, and suggest improvements.

---

### **240–255 min | Catalog Quick Hits: Advanced Reasoning Patterns**

* **Quick Tour:**

  * **Graph-of-Thoughts**
  * **Contrastive CoT**
  * **Program-Aided Reasoning**
  * **Meta-Prompting**
  * **Uncertainty Calibration**
  * **Self-Explanation Prompts**
  * **Self-Monitoring**
  * **Plan-then-Act**
  * **Iterative Reflection**
* *Students map which patterns they used today to their own learning or work scenarios.*

---

### **255–270 min | Recap, Homework & Preview**

* **Recap:**

  * CoT and its variants, ToT, GoT, ReAct, Plan-then-Act, meta-prompting, self-critique, validation, and iteration.
* **Homework:**

  1. Create one advanced reasoning prompt using either ToT, GoT, or ReAct.
  2. Run it with self-consistency and iterative refinement; submit logs.
  3. Write a meta-prompt to improve a previous prompt.
* **Preview:**

  * Day 6: Retrieval-augmented, domain-specific, user-personalized, and graph-based prompting; beginning the shift from logic to knowledge.

---

### **Supplementary Materials**

* **Colab/Notebook Labs:**

  * CoT/ToT/GoT chain templates, validation scripts, self-critique demo code.
* **Handouts:**

  * Reasoning pattern cheatsheet, advanced prompt structure guide, reflection/critique prompts.

---

**By end of Day 5:**
Students will have hands-on mastery of all major advanced reasoning prompt patterns, will know how to chain and critique complex reasoning, and can set up iterative, reflective pipelines for multi-step tasks and error reduction.
