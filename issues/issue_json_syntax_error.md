# CRITICAL: JSON syntax error in pal_plan_act_pipeline.ipynb prevents execution

## Problem
The `pal_plan_act_pipeline.ipynb` notebook has a JSON syntax error that prevents it from being loaded or executed.

## Details
- **Location**: Line 10, markdown cell
- **Error**: Duplicate content causing invalid JSON structure
- **Impact**: Notebook cannot be opened or run

## Current Code
```json
{
   "source": [
    "# PAL & Planâ€‘Thenâ€‘Act Pipeline\n",
    "LLM writes Python, we execute it, then ask LLM to explain."
    "LLM writes Python, we execute it, then ask LLM to explain.",  // <- duplicate line causing error
    "The Plan-and-Act Loop iteratively plans steps, executes them, and refines future actions using feedback.\n"
   ]
}
```

## Expected Fix
Remove the duplicate line and fix JSON formatting:
```json
{
   "source": [
    "# PAL & Planâ€‘Thenâ€‘Act Pipeline\n",
    "LLM writes Python, we execute it, then ask LLM to explain. The Plan-and-Act Loop iteratively plans steps, executes them, and refines future actions using feedback.\n"
   ]
}
```
