# Persona and Domain Swap Exercises

The following exercises encourage students to practice prompts by switching between personas or domains. These can be used in small group sessions or individual practice to build flexibility with prompt engineering.

1. **Alternate Roles**
   - One student adopts the persona of a well-known author or historical figure, while another student adopts the persona of a customer support agent. They role-play a short conversation about a simple topic such as "ordering coffee" or "planning a trip." Afterwards, they swap roles and repeat the conversation.

2. **Domain Shift**
   - Start with a prompt about technology, e.g., "Explain how to use a smartphone." Then restate the same instructions in an entirely different domain, such as cooking or fitness. Encourage students to use domain-specific language in each version.

3. **Character Swap**
   - Students create two characters with contrasting personalities, such as a strict teacher and a playful student. They swap personas halfway through a conversation about a lesson topic.

4. **Context Transformation**
   - Begin with a scenario set in a modern office. After a few lines, move the conversation to a fantasy or sci-fi setting while keeping the same general objectives. This helps practice adapting prompts for different narrative worlds.

5. **Expert vs. Novice**
   - Pair students so that one acts as an expert in a field and the other as a novice seeking advice. Midway through the dialogue, they switch roles. This encourages students to think from both perspectives and adjust the complexity of their responses.

Use these exercises to emphasize adaptability and creativity when working with various personas and domains. They help learners understand how different contexts influence prompts and responses.
