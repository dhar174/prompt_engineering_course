### **90–105 min | BREAK**

---

### **105–135 min | Robustness, Debugging, and Failure Analysis**

* **Iterative Prompt Debugging:**

  * Log, diagnose, revise, and retest.
* **Failure-Case Logging:**

  * Building a library of failures (and fixes).
* **Prompt Versioning:**

  * Controlled, traceable, safe iteration.
* **Prompt-Robustness Score:**

  * How to measure resilience to context shifts and adversarial attacks.
* **Group Exercise:**

  * Students swap a failed prompt and try to “fix” each other’s issues.

---

### **135–165 min | Adversarial & Stress Testing**

* **Robustness Adversarial Testing:**

  * Test with extreme/edge case inputs.
* **Hallucination-Rate Measurement:**

  * Detect and reduce false outputs.
* **Automated Adversarial Tests:**

  * Integrate with pipeline tools from Day 9.
* **Demo:**

  * Instructor stress-tests a mini-app with adversarial cases.

---

### **165–180 min | BREAK**

---

### **180–210 min | Continuous Optimization, Monitoring, and A/B Improvement**

* **Monitoring Pipelines:**

  * Continuous quality checks; catching drift and regressions.
* **Automated Improvement Loops:**

  * Reward models, feedback integration, reinforcement.
* **Versioned A/B Testing in Production:**

  * Rolling updates, rollback, and real-world safety nets.
* **Case Study:**

  * Team shares how they caught and fixed a real-world robustness issue.

---

### **210–240 min | Capstone Finalization Sprint**

* **Sprint:**

  * Students run a full evaluation (metrics + human review) on their capstone project.
  * Log, debug, iterate, and polish for Day 11 presentations.
* **Peer Review:**

  * Students exchange results and give improvement feedback.

---

### **240–255 min | Recap, Reporting, and Best Practices**

* **Best Practices Review:**

  * What to measure, how to interpret, when to escalate.
* **Prompt Libraries:**

  * Building a repository of best, robust, and versioned prompts for reuse.
* **Open Discussion:**

  * “What did you learn about evaluation and robustness you didn’t expect?”

---

### **255–270 min | Homework, Prep, and Final Preview**

* **Homework:**

  1. Submit your final capstone, with evaluation logs and a robustness checklist.
  2. Prepare a 5-minute demo/presentation for Day 11.
* **Preview:**

  * Day 11: Capstone presentations, peer review, big-picture synthesis, and next steps for pro-level prompt engineers.

---

### **Supplementary Materials**

* **Labs:**

  * A/B test templates, automated eval frameworks, versioning scripts, robustness checklist.
* **Handouts:**

  * Metrics/benchmark reference sheet, failure logging template, prompt repository starter pack.
